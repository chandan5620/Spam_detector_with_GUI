# Spam_detector_with_GUI
In this I created a project based on the python and machine learning. Which will help us in checking for the 'spam' message.In thaftris project I used some part of GUI(graphical user interface).
By usig GUI it is easy for the user to interect with the program.
In this project I used the github website for getting the dataset.
After that train machine based on that data and now it will detect your mesages as which message is 'spam' and which is not.
You have to write the message in the section and chick on the check button to check.
After clicking a pop-up will show where the 'SPAM' or 'HAM' is written.
